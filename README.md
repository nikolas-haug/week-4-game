Crystals Collector!

The game begins upon loading. 

Instructions: Collect crystals by clicking on the crystal images displayed. Each click reveals a hidden, and randomized, number of crystals, or points. If the number of crystals/points collected matches the crystal number above, you win and get to keep all your crystals. If you are too greedy, and collect too many, you lose the game and must return all of your crystals.

After you win or lose, press ENTER to begin a new game.

Each game begins with a new set of randomized numbers for the crystals and the crystal number. 

Enjoy!
